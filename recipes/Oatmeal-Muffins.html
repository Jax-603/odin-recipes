<h1>Chocolate Chip Banana Oatmeal Muffins</h1>
<img src="Oat-Muffins.webp">

<p>
<strong>Description:</strong>
<br>
These muffins are filled with oats, whole wheat flour, and bananas, and make an easy breakfast that is filling and healthy.
<br>
Yes, there are chocolate chips in them, but you could easily leave those out if you want them to be healthier.
<br>
Sorry, it can’t be helped. Banana muffins should have chocolate chips that’s just a fact.
<br>
Although I will admit that I would still happily eat one of these banana oatmeal muffins without the chocolate chips too.
