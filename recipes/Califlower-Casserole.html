Cauliflower Casserole, a Creamy and Cheesy Take on Cauliflower
If you were to ask me which cruciferous veggie I cook with most often, I would probably tell you that it's cauliflower.
<br>
Delicate in flavor and easy to work with (not to mention inexpensive), I use cauliflower in everything from making low-carb cauliflower rice, to cauliflower cheese soup, cauliflower mac and cheese, cauliflower curry, or these spiced cauliflower steaks.
I love how versatile it is, and how wonderfully it either blends into a dish or becomes the star!
And because cauliflower is such a stellar veggie, it makes for a delectable cauliflower casserole when combined with a creamy parmesan sauce and fontina cheese, plus a crispy parmesan and panko breadcrumb topping.
<br>
Baked until hot, bubbly and golden-brown, this scrumptious cauliflower casserole is a wonderfully cheesy and creamy side dish, sure to make everyone ask for seconds on their veggies!

<p>
  <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
<ul>
<li>4 ½ tablespoons unsalted butter, divided use</li> 
<li>2 cloves garlic, pressed through garlic press</li> 
<li>4 ½ tablespoons flour</li> 
<li>2 ½ cups milk (I use 2%)</li> 
<li>1 ¼ cup grated parmesan cheese, divided use</li> 
<li>Salt</li> 
<li>Black pepper</li> 
<li>½ cup panko breadcrumbs</li> 
<li>¼ teaspoon paprika</li> 
<li>3 pounds cauliflower florets, or cauliflower head, cut into florets</li> 
<li>¼ teaspoon granulated onion</li> 
<li>½ cup grated fontina cheese</li> 
<li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Preparation</strong>
<ol>
<li>Begin by gathering and prepping all of your ingredients according to the ingredient list above to have ready and organized for use.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 375°, and have medium-large baking dish (about 2 ½ quart size) ready on hand.</li>
<li>To prepare the parmesan sauce, place a medium-sized pot over medium heat. Add in 2 ½ tablespoons of the butter, and once it has melted, add in the garlic, and stir until aromatic.</li>
<li>Sprinkle in the flour evenly, and stir to create a roux, or a paste-like consistency. Then, pour in the milk, whisking all the while to avoid lumps.</li>
<li>Cook the mixture for about 5-6 minutes (whisking often), or until it comes to a vigorous simmer and thickens up.</li>
<li>Whisk in a pinch or two of salt (I used 1 teaspoon total) and a pinch of pepper, and remove the sauce from the heat. Add in 1 cup of the grated parmesan cheese, and whisk that in until well blended; set aside to keep warm.</li>
<li>Prepare your panko topping by mixing together the panko breadcrumbs with the remaining ¼ cup of the parmesan, plus the paprika. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, and drizzle that into the mixture, mixing it together with a fork. Set aside.</li>
<li>Blanch the cauliflower florets in salted simmering water for about 4-5 minutes, or until slightly tender yet still crisp/firm. Drain well and pat dry.</li>
<li>To assemble the cauliflower casserole, spread about 1 cup of the parmesan sauce onto the bottom of the baking dish. Add in the blanched cauliflower florets, and sprinkle over them the granulated onion.</li>
<li>Pour the remainder of the parmesan sauce over the seasoned cauliflower, smoothing it out, then sprinkle over the fontina cheese.</li>
<li>Sprinkle over the panko breadcrumb topping evening, then bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden-brown and crisp on top.</li>
<li>Garnish with chopped parsley and serve.</li>
